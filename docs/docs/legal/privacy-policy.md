# Privacy Policy
**Pocket TCG Ranked Leaderboard**  
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01

This Privacy Policy explains how the Pocket TCG Ranked Leaderboard bot ("the Bot") processes information when used in Discord servers.

## Information We Collect
- **Discord identifiers**: server ID, channel ID, user ID, and usernames.
- **Parsed game data**: season codes, ranks, points, placements, and win streaks extracted from submitted screenshots.
- **Anti-abuse hashes**: SHA-256 and perceptual hashes of images, used only to detect duplicate submissions.
- **Timestamps**: when submissions are made.

> **Note:** The Bot does *not* permanently store screenshots. Images are processed in memory, relevant stats are extracted, and the image data is then discarded.

## How We Use Data
- Provide and maintain leaderboards.
- Detect duplicates and prevent spam/abuse.
- Generate personal and server-level statistics.
- Improve accuracy and reliability of OCR parsing.

## Retention
- Parsed records are kept for the duration of the active season and archived for reference if enabled.
- Hashes are kept as long as necessary to prevent duplicate abuse, with periodic cleanup.
- Screenshots themselves are never retained.

## Sharing
- Data is never sold.  
- Shared only with service providers required to operate the Bot (e.g., hosting platforms).  
- May be disclosed if required by law.

## Security
Reasonable technical and organizational measures are applied to protect stored data. Access is limited to the service operator.

## Your Choices
- Remove the Bot from your server at any time.  
- Request deletion of server data by contacting support.
