### Season defaults

When a command accepts a `season` option and you leave it blank, the bot falls back to the server's current season. Season codes are normalized to uppercase internally.

## Command details

### `/ping`
*Response*: Sends `pong üèì` as an ephemeral reply so only you see the result.

Use it as a quick health check to confirm that the bot is online and responsive.

### `/setseason`
*Permissions*: Requires the **Manage Server** permission.

*Arguments*: `season` ‚Äî supply the new season code (for example, `A3`). The bot stores the season in uppercase automatically.

*Behavior*:
- Updates the stored season for the guild.
- Resets tracked leaderboard pages to page 1.
- Refreshes every tracked leaderboard message in the guild with the new season.

Use this whenever a new season begins or you need to correct the active season.

### `/setboard`
*Permissions*: Requires the **Manage Server** permission.

*Behavior*:
- Validates that the bot can view the channel, send messages, and embed links; it also attempts to pin the leaderboard message (needs **Manage Messages** for automatic pinning).
- Creates the leaderboard message for the current channel if it does not exist, or refreshes it if it does.
- Initializes the channel's leaderboard state to page 1 for the current season.

Run this in the channel where you want the pinned leaderboard embed to live.

### `/submit`
*Arguments*:
- `image` (required): Upload a ranked match screenshot (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.heic`, or `.heif`).
- `debug` (optional): Set to `true` to receive the raw OCR text back for troubleshooting.

*Behavior*:
- Reads the attachment and OCRs it to extract season, points, placement, rank, and win streak.
- Uses the detected season if present; otherwise falls back to the guild's current season. If neither is available, the command aborts and prompts an admin to set the season.
- Saves the submission in SQLite and updates the in-memory leaderboard snapshot.
- Sends you a recap of your latest stats and refreshes every tracked leaderboard message in the guild.

### `/history`

Arguments:
- `season` (optional): Defaults to the current season.

Behavior:
- Fetches your recent submissions for the chosen (or current) season.  
- Displays them as an ephemeral list including timestamp, rank, placement, and points.  
- If the stored rank is missing, the bot infers the rank from your points.

Use this to quickly review your personal match history for the season.


### `/remove_last`
*Arguments*: `season` (optional) ‚Äî defaults to the current season.

*Behavior*:
- Deletes your most recent submission for the selected season.
- Rebuilds your "latest" leaderboard entry from the remaining submissions (if any) and refreshes all guild leaderboards.
- Replies with your new latest stats or a notice that no entries remain.

### `/remove_all`
*Arguments*:
- `confirm` (boolean): Must be set to `true` to actually delete anything. If omitted or false, the command responds with a safety warning.
- `season` (optional): Defaults to the current season.

*Behavior*:
- Deletes every submission you have for the chosen season once confirmed.
- Refreshes your leaderboard entry and all guild leaderboards.
- Replies with the count of deleted submissions.

### `/leaderboard`
*Arguments*:
- `season` (optional): Defaults to the current season.
- `page` (number): Defaults to 1. Each page shows the next set of players.

*Behavior*: Returns an ephemeral embed containing the requested leaderboard page, including total players and pagination info.

### `/me`
*Arguments*: `season` (optional) ‚Äî defaults to the current season.

*Behavior*: Replies with your latest submission stats (points, placement, rank) and any recorded personal bests for the season.

### `/megraph`
*Arguments*:
- `season` (optional): Defaults to the current season.
- `days` (number): Defaults to 30. Limits the time window for the charts.

*Behavior*:
- Pulls your submission history for the chosen window.
- Generates PNG line charts for points and rank (if enough data exists) and sends them back as ephemeral attachments.

### `/diag`
*Response*: Prints Python, Pillow, pytesseract, and system Tesseract versions, or returns the exception raised during checks.

Use this to verify that OCR dependencies are installed correctly when debugging deployment issues.
